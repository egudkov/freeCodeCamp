Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

The algorithm to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is
the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.

You are given a variable celsius representing a temperature in Celsius.
Use the variable fahrenheit already defined and assign it the Fahrenheit
temperature equivalent to the given Celsius temperature. Use the algorithm
mentioned above to help convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.

Don't worry too much about the function and return statements as they
will be covered in future challenges. For now, only use operators
that you have already learned.

function convertToF(celsius) {
  const fahrenheit = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32;

  return fahrenheit;
}

console.log(convertToF(30));
